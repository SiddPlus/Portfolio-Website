    <h1>My Portfolio</h1> 

    <p>Welcome to my online portfolio! This site showcases a collection of my projects, demonstrating my skills in game programming. At the moment I am a year 3 student at University for the Creative Arts</p>
    
    <h2>Year 3</h2> 
    <p>I will be developing a total of 10 projects, including two Raylib (web-based) projects, seven Unity and Unreal Engine projects, one collaborative project, and a Final Major Project.</p>
    <p>Final Major Project: Developing a third-person multiplayer roguelike in Unreal Engine 5.6 using both C++ and Blueprints, featuring procedurally generated maps with the primary objective of launching on Steam as a capstone demonstration of both technical expertise and creative growth. Focus areas include procedural map generation, networked gameplay systems, and player progression mechanics. Responsible for leading programming tasks and to achieve cohesive gameplay and visual design.</p>
